			<h2>Overview</h2>
		</header>
		<p> I did several projects over the years, all my projects were stored on my laptop and then backed up to a icloud drive. This was before I understood the importance of version control, even in solo projects. However, even though they are old, it is funny how much I would over complicate easy tasks just to see if I could. Always challenging yourself is a key part of growth-- working just outside your limits and struggling. Below I list some of the projects that I WILL try toupload  have on GitHub and am excited to show you. </p>
